The objective of this job is to develop an application to perform unsupervised clusterization of electronic components to groups.
The input is a folder with images of components.
The components are supposed to be made by the same manufacturer and belong to the same group. In some cases, this is not the case and the folder may contain different population groups.
The purpose of this job is to develop an efficient application that inputs a folder with images and output each group to a separate sub-folder and plots a scatter-plot depicting the different groups.
The app will run on a laptop with GPU at a rate faster than 100 images/s.
Some examples of inputs are here:
